/*
 * VULNERABILITY EXPLANATION
 * -----------------------
 * The Telephone contract has a vulnerability in the changeOwner function:
 *
 * ```solidity
 * function changeOwner(address _owner) public {
 *     if (tx.origin != msg.sender) {
 *         owner = _owner;
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * This function checks if tx.origin is different from msg.sender, which creates a
 * security issue because:
 * 
 * - tx.origin: Always refers to the address that originally sent the transaction
 * - msg.sender: Refers to the immediate caller of the function
 *
 * EXPLOIT TECHNIQUE
 * -----------------------
 * We exploit this by creating an intermediary contract that calls the vulnerable function:
 * 
 * 1. Player calls TelephoneAttacker.attack()
 * 2. TelephoneAttacker calls Telephone.changeOwner()
 * 3. Inside Telephone.changeOwner():
 *    - tx.origin = Player's address (original transaction sender)
 *    - msg.sender = TelephoneAttacker's address (immediate caller)
 * 4. Since tx.origin â‰  msg.sender, the condition is met and ownership is transferred
 *
 * SECURITY LESSONS
 * -----------------------
 * Never use tx.origin for authorization purposes. Using tx.origin for authentication is
 * dangerous because it makes your contract vulnerable to phishing attacks.
 *
 * Instead:
 * - Use msg.sender for authorization checks
 * - Implement proper access control mechanisms
 * - Consider using OpenZeppelin's Ownable contracts for ownership management
 *
 * Additionally, understand the difference between tx.origin and msg.sender:
 * - tx.origin can be manipulated through intermediary contracts
 * - msg.sender is more reliable for verifying direct interactions
